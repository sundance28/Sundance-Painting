        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: January 05, 2026</strong></p>

        <p>At Sundance Painting (accessible at sundance28.github.io/Sundance-Painting), your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit our website or interact with our advertisements on Facebook (Meta Platforms).</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatically collected data</strong>: When you visit our site, we (and third parties like Meta) may collect non-personal information such as your IP address, browser type, device information, pages viewed, and time spent on the site. This is done via cookies and similar technologies, including the Meta Pixel.</li>
            <li><strong>Meta Pixel and Facebook Ads</strong>: We use the Meta Pixel to understand how users interact with our site after seeing or clicking our Facebook ads. This helps us measure ad effectiveness and show relevant ads. Meta may link this data to your Facebook account if you're logged in.</li>
            <li><strong>No direct personal collection</strong>: We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or other personal details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve our website and user experience.</li>
            <li>Run and optimize Facebook/Meta advertising campaigns (e.g., retargeting visitors with relevant ads).</li>
            <li>Comply with legal requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing and Selling of Information</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information to anyone.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We do not share your personal information with third parties</strong> except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With Meta Platforms, Inc. (Facebook) as necessary for advertising and analytics via the Meta Pixel (Meta processes this data under their own privacy policy).</li>
            <li>With service providers who assist us (e.g., web hosting), bound by confidentiality.</li>
            <li>When required by law (e.g., court order).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We never share or sell data for marketing purposes outside of Meta's advertising ecosystem.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>We and Meta use cookies and pixels for functionality and ads. You can manage cookies in your browser settings or opt out of personalized ads via Meta's settings: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" target="_blank">Facebook Ad Preferences</a>.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data. Contact us at sundancepainting@outlook.com to exercise these. For Meta-related data, visit Meta's Privacy Center: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank">Meta Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>If you're in California (CCPA/CPRA), we do not "sell" or "share" personal information as defined by law.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect information, but no method is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with the updated date.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>

Step 2: Add the new page to your GitHub website (takes 60 seconds)
Open this link in a new tab: https://github.com/sundance28/Sundance-Painting
Click the blue button that says Add file (near the top right)
Click Create new file
In the box that says "Name your file...", type exactly:
privacy.html
Delete any text that's already in the big white editor box.
Paste the entire code you copied in Step 1 into that big white box.
Scroll down to the bottom.
In the "Commit new file" section, type this message:
Add privacy policy
Click the green button Commit new file
That's it! Your new page is now live at:
https://sundance28.github.io/Sundance-Painting/privacy.html
(It may take 30-60 seconds to appear — just refresh the page if needed.)

Step 3: Add a link to your existing home page (so people can find the privacy policy)
On your GitHub repo page, click on index.html (your current home page file)
Click the pencil icon ✏️ (top right) to edit it
Look for the footer line that currently says:
<p>&copy; 2026 Sundance Painting. All rights reserved.</p>
Change that one line to exactly this:
<p>&copy; 2026 Sundance Painting. All rights reserved. <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p
